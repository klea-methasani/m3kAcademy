        <p>Casey McGuigan, Slingshot and Reveal product manager at Infragistics, explores the top software development challenges for 2023, according to the new Reveal 
            survey of software developers and IT professionals. These challenges include the shortage of developers, finding time to build apps, an inability to keep pace with
             innovations in developer tools, difficulty with third-party integrations, workload management, security threats, project management, and increased client expectations.
              Let’s look at solutions for addressing each challenge, including adopting low-code/no-code development tools, assessing new technologies before adopting them, digital 
              transformation platforms, and best practices for third-party integration.Software development is a complex and difficult process. It involves its own set of challenges,
               especially for today’s developers, as industry standards and technologies continue to evolve. The inability to keep pace with innovations in developer tools, manage projects 
               and handle increased client expectations can negatively impact software developers and their ability to complete tasks. It is crucial to understand these challenges and how to overcome them.  
            In this article, we will examine the top software development challenges for 2023 identified by Reveal’s surveyOpens a new window  of IT professionals and software developers. 
            Each year, Reveal (a product of Infragistics) surveys thousands of software developers and IT professionals to discover the obstacles developers faced in the previous year and shed
             light on future challenges. The survey aims to determine the industry’s biggest pain points, challenges, and areas for growth.  </p>

        <p>
            For the second year in a row, software developers and IT professionals said their biggest challenge is recruiting qualified talent. The survey also identified the most in-demand technical
             jobs for 2023, which are: DevOps Engineers, Data Analytics Developers, and IT Security Engineers.Finding and recruiting qualified developers is a challenge for several reasons. Lack of skilled talent, 
             a high cost of hiring and difficulty finding the right person for the job are among the top reasons for the shortage. The developer shortage has many implications for the tech industry, including
              higher costs, lost revenue, and difficulty competing and innovating. Among the ways organizations can overcome this challenge is to identify the skills they need, target candidates who possess those 
              specific skills or offer reskilling programs to current employees. In addition, many organizations are lessening the burden on developers by adopting new tools and technologies that reduce the need 
              for hand coding. Low-code/no-code tools allow developers to create fully functioning apps in minutes rather than weeks or months of traditional hand coding.   </p>
